seewave GUI is an user interface for generating publishing-ready, high quality visualizations of soundwaves (WAV) for bioacoustics based on R package seewave.

This is a preliminar version of an app made using Shiny.

Also available from my professional webpage: [diegryllid](https://diegryllid.github.io/).

**Tools:**  
The app allows rendering three types of plots:
  * _Oscillogram_
  * _Spectrogram_
  * _Averaged power spectrum_

Every plot can be customized with default themes (white, dark), or with a custom theme (including color and palette selectors) with the interactive panel.

This repossitory fulfills educational purposes only.
